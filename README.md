# My Python Practice Projects 🐍

This repository contains beginner Python projects completed as part of my coding journey.

## 📁 Projects Included

### 1. `day1_hello.py`
A simple introduction script that prints personal info using variables and `print()`.

### 2. `voters_eligibility_checker.py`
A script that checks if a user is eligible to vote based on their age using `if/else` logic.

### 4. `profile_generator.py`
Collects user input like name, age, and preferences and displays a formatted summary.
